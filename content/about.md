### What I interest

Cloud Computing is essential infrastructures for boosting digital world, but you have to **smartly** leverage these infrastructures to craft digital services. I'm interested in helping companies develop high-quality software products with lower costs by using Cloud-Native technique. In order to accomplish it, I often keeps the following methodologies in mind:

1. Think hard about what business problems you want to solve at current
2. Follow the best practices in software industry
3. Prefer to use out-of-the-box solution before it can't meet your requirements

So, points 2 and 3 is what I want to share and provide.
